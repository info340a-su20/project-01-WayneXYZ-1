                    <p>
                        Although it did not get much attention over mainstream media, natural disasters occur very frequently 
                        around the world and affect many people. From personal experience, I would get information of some 
                        significant natural disasters from the New York Times, the only major news agency, but the information 
                        often comes in the form of notification stripes, and users are less likely to acquire broader information 
                        regarding the disaster (i.e. associated / similar events) as the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2Qkmdug">reports</a> 
                        were often concentrated on that specific disaster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Natural disaster is an issue that stands above politics or society; it is something we humans should face together. 
                        Current resources lack up-to-date records, and news reporting services often would not provide a unified place 
                        specifically for natural disasters. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <h4 class="section-subtitle">IT | Existing Similar Products</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Acquiring a comprehensive set of natural disaster data would require researching on major 
                        agencies or institutes around the world whose results could cover as much of the globe as possible. 
                        <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters#atsr-world-fire-atlas-by-the-european-space-agency-esa">
                            An existing website
                        </a> thoroughly covers the result and data visualizations of disasters prior to 2019; 
                        however, its interactability is very limited: the contents on the website are designed to present long 
                        texts that explain stuff, and interactive visualizations are put at a very low position. 
                        This illustrates the difficulties of developing a product that could self-update and is oriented 
                        toward interaction and association of natural disaster. With the interaction state-of-mind, 
                        the process could involve model making as the first step. I believe a unified source of such information would also
                        make it easiers for NGOs to work on their agendas of helping with the disasters when governments fail to respond.

                <h3 class="section-title">App Description</h3>

                With an empathetic mind, I have thought of a platform that fills such a gap throughout the past year. 
                The product would contain relatively more comprehensive-in-width information regarding natural disasters. 
                I envisioned the web app to:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>- contain up-to-date information of various types of natural disasters</strong>;<br>
                <strong>- give the user related information, such as impact on societal and economic levels</strong>;<br>
                <strong>- providing related disasters and comparison in the past</strong>;<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The website would be a combination of interactive dashboard and documentation. As referenced above,
                an existing website presents well-explained background knowledge to natural disasters. Attempting to extend
                what it did well, I want to promote the weights of interactive elements, add more tables and charts that
                present relative information in a more tailored way.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <h4 class="section-subtitle">User Story</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I imagine the users of this web app to care about the nature and its
                        interaciton with human to a certain extent, afterall, it's a disaster
                        platform. The user might be someone working for an environmental assistant
                        or humanitarian NGO, a student studying related fields, or even a researcher
                        looking for some primary data. Perhaps the user would read the description of a certain
                        natural disaster or compare two or more similar events, cross-evaluate their impact on
                        the people. They might use the economic impact or governmental response comparison as a
                        source for their research in sociology, environmental study, or political science.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <h4 class="section-subtitle">Information | Interaction</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Given the self-update nature I envisioned for the web app, it could draw data from
                        geographic institutes or disaster control centers who disclose and update their information.
                        The app's goal would be to cover as much area of the world as possible, not leaving anyone
                        behind. This means the source-selection will need to be re-examined once in a while to ensure
                        that the institute is still providing up-to-date information.
                        The essential guarantee of the web app will be a sustainable and easy-to-navigate
                        interaction between the information of each disaster and the data visualizations and
                        components that unifies them.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                In short, when designing the web app, it would be beared in mind that the user will need as little
                effort as possible to navigate through the interactions and different types of disaster data 
                analysis would be related in a straight-forward way: the user will need a low amount of input to
                get what they want (and what they can get).
